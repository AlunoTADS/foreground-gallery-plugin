# Foreground Gallery Plugin for Phonegap (Cordova) #

The default Phonegap (Cordova) Gallery Plugin calls the native photo gallery and this makes Android Garbage Collector to kill background applications. This plugin avoid your application to go background and be killed by Garbage Collector with other applications. We used the Phonegap source code and modified it to avoid this problem. This plugin works only with DATA URL.

## Contributions ##
